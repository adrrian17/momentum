# Runtime and deployment

Read this guide when changing the server runtime, database, environment schemas, or deployment configuration.

## Cloudflare and database

- The web app and server target Cloudflare. Worker database access uses the native `DB` binding defined in `packages/infra/alchemy.run.ts`.
- Use Drizzle migrations in `packages/db/src/migrations`. Alchemy applies them during deployment and when `alchemy dev` creates the local database.
- In development, apply schema changes to the local D1 with `pnpm run db:push`; never generate or apply migrations for development. It writes only to the SQLite file `alchemy dev` keeps under `packages/infra/.alchemy/local/d1`, so run `pnpm run dev` once first. Generate a migration only when the change ships to production.
- Keep `CORS_ORIGIN` aligned with the deployed web origin. Verify the Alchemy stage before deploying or destroying resources.

## Environment configuration

- Environment schemas live in `.env.schema`. Regenerate `src/env.ts` with `pnpm run env:generate` after schema changes. Keep secrets in ignored environment files or platform configuration.
- Use the app's environment accessor. Workers read native bindings through the existing server integration, and browser code uses `apps/web/src/env.public.ts`.
- Run standalone environment-dependent tools from the owning application directory. Generating types does not initialize environment values for another command.

## Commands

Run these from the repository root:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install` | Install dependencies and generate environment types |
| `pnpm run dev` | Start the Alchemy development environment |
| `pnpm run db:push` | Push the Drizzle schema to the local dev D1 |
| `pnpm run db:generate` | Generate Drizzle migration files for production |
| `pnpm run env:generate` | Regenerate environment types |
| `pnpm run deploy` | Deploy the selected Alchemy stage |
| `pnpm run destroy` | Destroy resources in the selected Alchemy stage |

See the [README setup and deployment instructions](../../README.md) for details. Update affected guides when commands or configuration responsibilities change.
